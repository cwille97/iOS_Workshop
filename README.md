# iOS_Workshop
Open Web iOS Workshop for Fall 2018 

Part 1 will consist of building the iOS app, part 2 will consist of setting up a FireBase Cloud FireStore and linking it to this app.

This app will be sort of like a notice board where users can post a question or statement and then other users can read this and comment on it
